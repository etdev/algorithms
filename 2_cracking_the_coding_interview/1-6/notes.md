### The problem
Write a method that rotates an image (represented by an NxN matrix of pixels, where each pixel is 4 bytes), by 90 degrees.In place if possible.

### Initial algorithm attempt
```java
```
### Iteration #1
```java
```

### Final algorithm
```java
```

### Tests
```java
```

Output:
```java
```

### THOUGHTS
* I'm not sure what form the NxN matrix is in, which irks me slightly.  If this
  were a real interview I would probably ask my interviewer, but I guess I'll
just assume it's a 2-dimensional array and if that turns out to not be the case,
edit my answer.
* It shouldn't matter what's contained in the pixels anyway.  I think the only
  thing that matters is the indices, if we assume they're in an array.
* The java ``||`` and ``&&`` conditional operators short-circuit.
